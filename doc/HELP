Ghostbuster : Extract blog content from Ghost database into files

This is a tool that extracts content from a Ghost (http://www.ghost.org)
system into files. The primary use-case is to store post data into a
version control system such as Git (http://www.git-scm.com).

The extracted files may also be used to host a lightweight copy of the
blog on a static web server. An index page is generated and this can
be used as a landing page on such a static web server.

Quick Start
-----------

Those that don't want to read the detail can try this:

$ ghostbuster /path/to/content /path/to/repository

Detail
------

    ghostbuster [OPTIONS] SOURCE [DESTINATION]

Ghostbuster extracts content from the "content" directory of a Ghost
directory tree. The SOURCE is the directory location of the Ghost
installation whose contents should be extracted. The DESTINATION is
the directory location to where the content should be extracted to.

The following content is extracted :

  1. Posts
  2. Directories

SOURCE is mandatory. If it does not end in '/content' then this will be
added automatically, so "/path/to/ghost" and "/path/to/ghost/content"
are equivalent. 

DESTINATION is optional. If not given, the destination will be the same
as SOURCE. Only posts will be extracted and they will be written to the
SOURCE. 

If SOURCE and DESTINATION are different then Ghostbuster will also copy
the content directories specified by the --copydirs option, which should
be given as a comma-separated list. If the --copydirs option is not used
then a default value of "images,themes/active-theme" will be used where
"active-theme" is the active theme defined by Ghost's settings page.

Posts are written as separate files with names in the following format:

  ID - TITLE.TYPE

where ID is the post ID assigned by Ghost, TITLE is the post's title and
TYPE is the file type: both html and markdown files will be written.

In addition, an index.html file is written containing links to all posts.
If the extracted files are placed on a web server, this can serve as a
landing page. For example, point a local web browser directly at the
extract destination (file://DESTINATION/index.html)

Ghostbuster will, by default, extract all posts. To only extract posts
that have been published, use the --published option.

Posts will be extracted to html, markdown and yaml. To only extract to
a subset of these, specify one or more of the --html, --markdown and
--yaml options.
